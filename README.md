TODO:
- set up Unity scene
- create/get a 1:1 model of the ride track (or as close as possible)
- physics model
- ride control system and safety systems
  - switch tracks, reverse track, turntable
  - block zoning, multi train ops, train swaps
- show control system and triggers
- get assets (animatronics models/video/audio/props)
- rider throughput and operations sim
  - stretch: load/unload
  - stretch: employee positions sim
